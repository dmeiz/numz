      Existing tags are displayed as I type to give me a hint at what tag I might use.

OLD LOG
-------

20080503
Using git logs to record this nonsense.

20080427
Updated Tag to a has and belongs to many relationship with Num. 

20080409
Added Tag.  Use merb-gen to generate things.

20080407
Log with Merb.logger.debug("...").

Got validation errors displaying.

20080406
Added a new handler to Chronic to handle the date issue.  I added it to
config.init in the post-load block.

Started troubleshooting validations.

20080405
Reworked controller to validate and report errors.  Installed merb_has_flash plugin.  Discovered bug in Chronic: it doesn't parse "January 15, 2008".

20080404
Upgraded to merb-0.9.2 to make use of merb-assets, including these methods:

  css_include_tag "calendar_date_select/default"
  js_include_tag "prototype"
  include_required_js
  require_js "new.js"

Made some real progress integrating CalendarDateSelect.  Bailed on the port
from Rails; decided to use straight Javascript.  

Started validation of Num.

20080320
Added Prototype.  Started adding CalendarDateSelect:

  http://code.google.com/p/calendardateselect/

It's a Rails plugin, but I'm trying to integrate it.

20080319
Looked for a date/time picker and found this:

  http://www.razum.si/jQuery-calendar/TimeCalendar.html

Started reading a little about jQuery.

20080318
Looked into DataMapper refactor, but it's a little too green.  It doesn't
support double yet.

20080312
Created Nums controller with new and list actions.  Need to store more precise floats.

20080311
Created Num and Unit models.

20080310
Install haml gem.  Added 'dependency merb-haml"' to init.rb to enable it.
Tweaked application.html.haml to see if it worked.

20080308
Commited merbful_authentication.

20080304
Generated merbful_authentication.  Had to enable merb_helpers in
config/init.rb.  Was able to get the form to diplay.

20080303
Installed merbful_authentication from git source.  Needed to checkout origin
branch to get package tasks?  Git is nuts.  Enabled DataMapper and create User
model.  Installed merb_rspec gem from merb-plugins src.  Found this recent post:

  http://rorblog.techcfl.com/2008/02/20/merborial-up-and-running-with-merb-090-dev/

20080302
Started install of merbful_authentication from this post:

  http://hassox.blogspot.com/2008/01/merbful-authentication-is-born.html

Needed to first install merb-core from trunk:

20080224
Starting the project.
